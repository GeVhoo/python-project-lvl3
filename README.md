Hello World!

This is my third project that i do in Hexlet course.
It is a useful utility to download addresses from the network.

Functions:
* You can specify the folder in which you want to download the finished file.
* The utility downloads all resources on the page and changes the page so that it starts to link to local versions.

Hope you enjoy it!
